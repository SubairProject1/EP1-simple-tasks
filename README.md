# Programming Tasks – Einführung in Programmierung 1

This repository contains six programming exercises covering core introductory programming topics. The tasks progress in difficulty and include creating simple drawings, working with arrays and data structures, and implementing basic algorithms.

The highlight is Task 6, where I developed a top-down 2D game: a character can move in four directions, pushing boxes toward goal tiles to solve each level.
